<p>Hello World, My name is Raul Junqueira da Silva, I am 25 years old and I have been living in Australia for almost 6 years now, I was born in Brazil, to be more specific in the state of Sao Paulo, one of the biggest cities in the world, so the life in Sydney was not too hard to adapt.</p>
	<br></br>

When I was 19, Giulya, my girlfriend at the time and now wife helped me to decide to leave Brazil and try a new life in another country. But Raul, why Australia? Well that is a good question, the weather is almost the same and we love to be around the ocean, it is one of the best countries to be living in the XXI century and we love the freedom we have here.</p>

<h1>Why IT?</h1>

<h2>This is the first time I am studying after I left High School, and the first time I am studying in English, as it is not my first language, if you do not know, in Brazil we speak Portuguese.
	<br></br>
I always wanted to learn more about the technologies that are changing our lives so quick, I never wanted to feel that I was just being left behind, so the interest in studying IT came up and now that I have the chance and the opportunity to do an online course I feel like my dream can become reality as Permanent Residency in Australia got granted.
	<br></br>
I never had much experience with IT but my older brother was always the guy that was sorting all the tech problems for the family and friends, so he was teaching me some of his skills since I was around 12.
	<br></br>
I chose RMIT because it can give me the freedom to keep my full-time job and at the same time pursuing a career that I want to have in future.
	<br></br>
I expect to finish these three years with enough skills that can make me capable to put my brain to work and make all the ideas that are always in my mind reality.</h2>
	<br></br>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
	<br></br>
<h2>Honestly, I still donâ€™t know what is the ideal job in the IT industry, however, I have a feeling that developing and Designing Apps makes me very excited. I will need a couple more years to have all the skills needed for the role and my main idea is to work on my own projects, Therefore, if I could pick one job today it would be something like this Job listing on Seek.com.
	<br></br>
It consists in to be part of a team and develop cloud-based Apps for the Government of Australia, seems interesting and also the idea of working from home suits what I plan for my future.
The salary is not shown but as I could see in a similar listing I would be comfortable with it.

The results displayed by the tests are just a summary of some of my particularities that have always been present in my school life. Since I was little I have had a sense of leadership and an immense desire to innovate with every step I take in my studies and professional life. I like to take responsibility and discuss with the team always influencing the work to be done to get better every day. Creativity was never an issue, and I always enjoyed doing the presentation part of schoolwork. At work, I always take a leadership stance and assume the main responsibilities so that the results of the company and the team become an example for others.

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
	<br></br>
<h2>HappyPet APP
	<br></br>

Happy Pet is an App for smartphones that contain most of the information you need when going out with your PET, it will display from dog-friendly parks or beaches to caution that you must take in that area, like harm plants that could be dangerous for dogs, risk of snakes, where clean water is available and even Emergency Hospitals in case of an accident. Users will be able to update the App as they please, for example, if a park is closed on that day or if a beach is off-leash or on-leash for dogs.
	<br></br>
The motivation for this App came up when I had my first puppy, there is a massive lack of information on the Internet and sometimes I had to contact places to know if they were pet-friendly or not, counting that there are over 29 million pets in Australia, and we have one of the highest pet ownership rates in the world. Approximately 61% of households in Australia own pets, with dogs being the most common (40%), followed by cats (27%). [Font: RSPCA]
	<br></br>
The idea is to start in Australia and then expand it Worldwide.
	<br></br>
The app will be a way to make the life of people in love with pets even easier, the intention is to remove the concerns of the owners when making your pet happy, don't worry about extensive research to find out if your dog can enter a specific beach, or you can take your dog to that beachfront pub after an afternoon walk, whether it's safe to walk your best friend along the trails on a family trip, or you need to be careful with venomous animals along the way.
	<br></br>
Not only during leisure time, if you have a pet, you know that accidents happen, but you can also be walking along the beach playing catch and your dog can step on jellyfish in the sand, now what? What to do? In the app, there will be a huge help platform that has advanced research and also help from pet owners who have been through the same situation, where is the nearest emergency hospital? What should I do until then? There will be a tab in the app that has pet first aid help for things that can happen in everyday life.
	<br></br>
There will also be a tab with a breed guide, where the owner can find dogs of the same breed and meet in a park in the region, this is something that exists a lot these days in social networking groups, but with the app, it would be easier and more focused.
	<br></br>
The idea of the user interface will be a map tab with icons of different colours that will have their respective meanings, for example: if I'm looking for pet-friendly restaurants green icons would appear on the map,  with that I would click on the icon and know details about the place and the distance from my location, following the same rationale, blue icons would appear for beaches for dogs, purple for parks, red for hospitals and so on. Data demonstrate that the human brain handles colours and subtitles very well. This would make the platform an easy search.
	<br></br>
In conclusion find nearby attractions, upcoming dog events, and local resources such as dog walkers, groomers, sitters, veterinarians, and pet supply stores. Don't see your favourite place listed? Use our app to post a new pet-friendly location and share a photo of your dog enjoying his favourite spot. Browse our dog photo section and share pics with your dog-loving friends on your Social Media.
	<br></br>
In brief research, it showed that PHP language or JavaScript work well in a Mostly map App.
	<br></br>
It would need an Open-source Library to open data into a map, be a self-editing app, as users could interact and make changes on it, and also it would need to have an interaction with Maps so it could track where you are and show you all you need to know in that specific area when taking your best friend.
	<br></br>
To start developing this project Idea, Knowledge in programming Apps would be essential, JavaScript and PHP are some examples of it. It would also need Marketing skills to make the idea known to the public and Data skills to make the App run smooth, User Interface and User Experience skills would be needed as well as a communication team.
	<br></br>
If this Project works it would be an extraordinary change for PET owners, as one of them I know the struggle that we go through when thinking about going out with our Fur friends. The crescent Data uploaded by the users would also make a massive difference in terms of misinformation out there, as every one of us is using the App looking for a better way to spend more time with our Pets. </p></h2>
